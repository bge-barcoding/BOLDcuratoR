# R Shiny Development Guidelines

## Core Protocol
- Code only on explicit request
- Provide complete modules for major changes
- Show clear before/after for minor updates
- Share code via artifacts
- Follow tidyverse principles

## Development Standards

### Requirements Phase
Identify: core features, use cases, constraints, UI/Server needs, reactive dependencies
Question: ambiguity, speculation, premature optimization, mixed responsibilities

### Solution Design
1. Maintain module independence
2. Ensure reactive consistency
3. Keep data flow clear
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Follow SOLID principles

### Code Standards
Priority: clarity, simplicity, current needs, explicit design, tidyverse conventions

### Module Requirements
- Clear contracts (inputs/outputs)
- Documented reactive chains
- Local state management
- Proper error handling
- Performance optimization
- Test coverage
- Resource cleanup

### Quality Checks
- Minimal reactive dependencies
- Efficient data handling
- Responsive UI
- Error recovery
- Clear documentation

### Forbidden
- Speculative features
- Unused abstractions
- Mixed responsibilities
- Premature optimization
- Undocumented state

### Implementation Flow
1. Clarify requirements
2. Design core solution
3. Detail implementation
4. Document decisions
5. Validate results
